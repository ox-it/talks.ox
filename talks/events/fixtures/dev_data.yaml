    description: Nature has evolved complex materials that are exquisitely designed
      to perform specific functions. Certain proteins and glycans self-organize in
      vivo into soft and dynamic, strongly hydrated gel-like matrices. Even though
      biological hydrogels are ubiquitous in living organisms and fulfill fundamental
      biological tasks, we have today a very limited understanding of their internal
      organization, and how they function. The main reason is that this type of assemblies
      is difficult to study with conventional biochemical methods. This talk will
      focus on peri- and extracellular matrices that are rich in large polysaccharides
      from the glycosaminoglycan family, in particular hyaluronan. In order to study
      biological hydrogels directly on the supramolecular level, we have developed
      an unconventional approach that draws on knowledge from several scientific disciplines.
      Exploiting surface science tools, we tailor-make model systems by directed self-assembly
      of purified components on solid supports. With a toolbox of biophysical characterization
      techniques, including QCM -D, ellipsometry, AFM and RICM , these model systems
      can be investigated quantitatively and in great detail. The experimental data,
      combined with polymer theory, allow us to develop a better understanding of
      the relationship between the supramolecular organization and dynamics of biological
      hydrogels, their physico-chemical properties and their biological function.
      To illustrate this concept, I will present a few examples, including recent
      works on the cross-linking of glycan-rich extracellular matrices (such as the
      jelly-like matrix around the mammalian egg that is crucial for fertility), and
      on "superselective" targeting of the cell surface through multivalent interactions
      between hyaluronan polymers and cell surface receptors.

    description: "There has been a mind shift in software engineering for how software\
      \ is built and managed. The software industry has been experiencing mainly three\
      \ major trends. The first is the shift towards agility and leanness in software\
      \ development. Being lean and agile is reflected both in practices and in outcomes.\
      \ The second shift is re-definition of business models in order to distribute\
      \ the development within a country and/or across borders to get benefits such\
      \ as low cost, high productivity and time shifting. The third is the increase\
      \ in scale of software systems. Furthermore, there is high uncertainty in how\
      \ these will change in the near future. The software industry has already been\
      \ experiencing considerable challenges in project effort and cost estimating.\
      \ Many projects fail or the ones delivered are with huge time and cost over-runs.\
      \ Poor estimating processes and the uncertainty in requirements have been widely\
      \ blamed for as major causes of the problems. In spite of the facts that considerable\
      \ efforts have been put forth on improving estimations, it seems the problem\
      \ continues to persist. The aim of this talk is to elaborate on the \u2018fundamental\
      \ issues of poor estimating\u2019 in software engineering. In particular; issues\
      \ related to lack of standard and useful measures, well designed measurement\
      \ instruments, and miss-conceptions in use of measures will be discussed by\
      \ comparing the practices to those of mature engineering fields."

    description: Conceptual spaces (sometimes also called semantic spaces) are high-dimensional
      geometric spaces in which entities are modelled as points and categories as
      convex regions. Given a relevant text corpus, conceptual spaces can be induced
      from data by using dimensionality reduction methods such as multi-dimensional
      scaling. To date, conceptual spaces are mainly used for measuring similarity.
      In this talk, I will argue that many aspects of semantic relatedness can be
      identified with qualitative spatial relations in conceptual spaces, and that
      this allows us to learn symbolic knowledge about categories in a purely data-driven
      way. As a simple example, the spatial part-of relation corresponds to the conceptual
      is-a relation, which is useful for automatically refining taxonomies. Second,
      spatial betweenness in conceptual spaces is useful for identifying "intermediary
      concepts". For example, we can think of a tapas bar as being intermediate between
      a pub and a restaurant, and accordingly we can expect the representation of
      "tapas bar" to be geometrically between the representations of "restaurant"
      and "pub" in a conceptual space of places. Finally, relative attributes such
      as "more violent than" (for films) or "more tannic than" (for wines) can be
      associated with direction relations in a conceptual space. The aforementioned
      spatial relations are useful for implementing various patterns of commonsense
      reasoning. Betweenness, for example, can be used to implement a symbolic counterpart
      to numerical interpolation, e.g. from the knowledge that bars and restaurants
      sell drinks, we derive that tapas-bars are also likely to sell drinks. Direction
      relations are useful for implementing a fortiori inference (and other forms
      of analogical reasoning). For example, given that Die Hard has received an 18
      certificate from the British Board of Film Classification and that Drive is
      more violent than Die Hard, we can plausibly derive that Drive has also received
      an 18 certificate. I will report the result of experiments that show the usefulness
      of the aforementioned patterns of commonsense reasoning. For example, we have
      found that a betweenness based classifier, using a conceptual space of place
      types induced from Flickr, outperforms humans in categorising places from the
      Foursquare and Geonames taxonomies. Similarly, by identifying qualitative direction
      relations in a conceptual space of films (derived from a large corpus of film
      reviews), we can implement a form of analogical reasoning which outperforms
      standard classifiers in a variety of film related categorisation tasks.
