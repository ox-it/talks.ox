Copy talks to your own calendar
===============================

You can put the details of any talk into your Nexus, Google or iCloud calendar. How this works depends on the browser and calendar you are using; we've covered some of the standard combinations here. The following steps will work for either a single talk or a series of talks.

.. Note:: Using this method, if the talk information changes in any way, the information in your own calendar **won't update automatically**. You should always check Oxford Talks to make sure that the time or location hasn't changed since you added the talk to your calendar.

Find the Add to Calendar link

* Click OK and don't worry, this just refers to the link back to the original talk. It will be copied over to the event notes and will be clearly visible
* Your talk(s) will be added to your chosen calendar

Using Chrome and Google Calendar
--------------------------------

* Clicking on the calendar icon in Chrome will download a file to your computer - you can usually see this at the bottom of your browser.
* The filename will be a list of numbers, letters and dashes ending in '.ics' e.g: 7545e0bc-b53c-4114-b3b7-fba953a08f74.ics
